## Buildroot : 
````
Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool, 
to generate embedded Linux systems through cross-compilation.
The documentation can be found in the docs/manual.
You can generate a text document with 'make manual-text' 
and read output/docs/manual/manual.text. Online documentation can be found below
````
### To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:
````
0) Have fun!
1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images
You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.
Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards and chipsets.
Run 'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.
Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
