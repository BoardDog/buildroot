	  Log4c is a library of C for flexible logging to files, syslog and other destinations.
	  It is modeled after the Log for Java library (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/),
	  staying as close to their API as is reasonable. Here is a short introduction to Log4j
	  which describes the API, and design rationale.
