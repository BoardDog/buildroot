	  nginx_substitutions_filter is a filter module which can do both regular
	  expression and fixed string substitutions on response bodies. This
	  module is quite different from the Nginx's native Substitution Module.
	  It scans the output chains buffer and matches string line by line, just
	  like Apache's mod_substitute
